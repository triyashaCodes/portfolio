👋🏼 Hello there, I’m Triyasha!

🚀 I’m a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning.

🔬 My interests lie in AI, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).

📚 I am currently trying to learn recent technologies in AI and how to deploy and maintain scalable AI-driven applications.

💡 I enjoy following recent advancements in LLMs, and I am passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world challenges.

Selected Experience
======
## 🤖 Nutanix MTS2

I developed **scalable security solutions** and **AI-powered systems** to enhance performance and security. I won the **10th Global Nutanix Hackathon** by creating a **smart security recommendation system** and an **AI-driven password vulnerability model**, now advancing to a commercial product. I built **secure password management and synchronization APIs** in **Golang and Python**, improving security and efficiency by **20%**, and designed a **crash-resistant multi-party authorization system** to mitigate ransomware risks. Additionally, I led the **migration of 50+ APIs** to a new gateway, enhancing performance and maintaining **90% regression accuracy**.


## 🔥 AIISC, University of South Carolina 
I contributed to **NLP and AI research** focused on **mental health, substance abuse analysis, and cognitive decline detection**. My work involved building **BERT-based models** to analyze **10,000+ Reddit posts**, achieving **85% accuracy**, and incorporating historical sentiment with time-aware neural models. I also designed a **gender-sensitive RoBERTa-based system** to detect **mental health symptoms in cardiovascular disease**, improving **symptom and gender-specific recall by 2.5%**, and fine-tuned **BERT models** to predict **cognitive decline**, achieving **87% accuracy**.
